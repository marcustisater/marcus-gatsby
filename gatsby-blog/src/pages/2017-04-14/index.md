Last week we organized our seventh local WordPress meetup in Stockholm 🙌 and for this one we wanted to show a preview of the new upcoming WordPress editor, Gutenberg. We had 8 particpants who was willing to give it a try.

It was very interesting to see how the users approached the editor, all the tests were very unique and fun to watch.

Watch the full video and let me know if you want me to upload any raw footage from any of the tests!

## 👍

* Toolbar is accessible and close by while editing.
* Keyboard shortcuts like `ctrl + b` for bold. Shortcuts in general.
* Moving blocks of content with up/down arrows.
* Minimalistic for front-end editing.
* Self-descriptive.

## 👎

* Skeptical about the way you add new blocks of content.
* Finding the quote and headline button was difficult.
* No context clicking.
* New is scary (learning phase).

I will for sure follow up on the Gutenberg editor development. I'm super excited! Are you? Let me know.
